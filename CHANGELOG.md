## Unreleased
### Added
- [popOS_setup.sh](popOS_setup.sh):
	- Given that now some post-install.d processes use parallelization to run things in the
		background and work faster, a `wait` command was implemented in the final clean-up step so
		users don't close the shell while things are still running.
- [packages.txt](packages.txt):
	- There's a new entry in the Development category called **Debian Packaging (.deb)**, which lists
		`dpkg-dev` and `debhelper`, two packages needed to create .deb packages.
- [flatpaks.txt](flatpaks.txt):
	- The app *Metadata Cleaner* was added to the list.
### Changed
- [popOS_setup.sh](popOS_setup.sh):
	- There `Separate` function was optimized.
- [packages.txt](packages.txt):
	- The **Gitg** entry in the Development category was renamed to **Git & Gitg**.
- [post-install.d](post-install.d):
	- Some files now use child subshells that run in parallel `( .. ) &` to speed things up by
		running things in the background.
- [git.sh](post-install.d/git.sh):
	- Tweaked the git slog alias so it does not specify the number of commits to show, allowing the
	  user to specify it instead.
	- The `now-ignored` alias was renamed to `list-ignored` because the keyword list better explains
	  what the alias does.
- [init.vim](samples/nvim.vim):
	- The filetype *gitcommit* was added to an autocommand group to display colorcolumns at columns
	  50 and 70 to help keep git commit messages at a reasonable length.
	- The color of the mode in the statusline was changed to blue.
- [.vimrc](samples/vimrc):
	- The filetype *gitcommit* was added to an autocommand group to display colorcolumns at columns
	  50 and 70 to help keep git commit messages at a reasonable length.
	- The color of the mode in the statusline was changed to blue.
- [mc_server_builder.sh](scripts/mc_server_builder.sh):
	- The version was updated to 1.18.1.
### Removed
- [git.sh](post-install.d/git.sh):
	- The alias `mrc` was removed because it is only useful in very rare situations.
